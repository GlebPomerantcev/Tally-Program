# Tally-Program
5 Friends (let's call them a, b, c, d and e) are playing a game and need to keep track of the scores. Each time someone scores a point, the letter of his name is typed in lowercase. If someone loses a point, the letter of his name is typed in uppercase. Give the resulting score from highest to lowest.
